Scheduler Bot
==============

A Discord bot that maintains weekly availability of members in a server.

### Setup

- Uses Golang 1.9.2
- Uses [discordgo v0.17.0](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo)
- Uses [go-sqlite3 v1.4.0](https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3)
- [Create a bot and client token associated with it](https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token)
- Create a file called `discord_token.json` based off of the template and place your client token in there

    Example:
    
    ```json
    {
      "Token": "Bot Token generated by Discord"
    }
    ```
- Running the bot creates a sqlite file, `scheduler.sqlite` which should not be modified outside of the program
